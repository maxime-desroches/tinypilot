        <h1 class="title-FAQ">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>
        <button class="accordion" @click="toggleFaq(0)">What is openpilot?</button>
            <div class="panel faq" v-bind:style="{maxHeight: getFaqHeight(0)}">
            <p>comma openpilot is an open source driver-assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Automated Lane Centering (ALC) for compatible vehicles. It performs similarly to Tesla Autopilot and GM Super Cruise. openpilot can steer, accelerate, and brake automatically for other vehicles within its lane. Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot" target="_self">GitHub</a>.</p>
            <p>In order to enforce driver alertness, openpilot includes a camera based Driver Monitoring (DM) system that alerts the driver when distracted or asleep. However, even with an attentive driver, we must make further efforts for the system to be safe. We have designed openpilot with two other safety considerations:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The driver must always be capable to immediately retake manual control of the vehicle, by stepping on either pedal or by pressing the cancel button.</li>
                <li>The vehicle must not alter its trajectory too quickly for the driver to safely react. This means that while the system is engaged, the actuators are constrained to operate within reasonable limits.</li>
            </ol>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion" @click="toggleFaq(1)">How does openpilot work?</button>
            <div class="panel faq" v-bind:style="{maxHeight: getFaqHeight(1)}">
            <p>openpilot works by taking the radar data integrated with supported car models and combining it with the camera built into comma hardware, to determine what acceleration, braking, and steering events are required.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion" @click="toggleFaq(2)">What should I buy to run openpilot in my car?</button>
            <div class="panel faq" v-bind:style="{maxHeight: getFaqHeight(2)}">
            <p>After verifying that your car is <a href="https://comma.ai/vehicles" target="_self">compatible</a>, we recommend purchasing a comma device in our <a href="https://comma.ai/shop" target="_self" rel="undefined">shop</a>. Don't forget to purchase a car harness to connect it to your vehicle. Add to cart, check out, and youâ€™re good to go!</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion" @click="toggleFaq(3)">Do I have to pay attention?</button>
            <div class="panel faq" v-bind:style="{maxHeight: getFaqHeight(3)}">
            <p>Yes, the driver must always be able to immediately retake manual control of the vehicle, by stepping on either pedal or by pressing the cancel button. When openpilot is engaged, a driver monitoring system actively tracks driver awareness to help prevent distractions. The openpilot system disengages if you are distracted. Drivers must keep their eyes on the road at all times and be ready to take control of the car.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion" @click="toggleFaq(4)">What are the limitations of openpilot Automated Lane Centering?</button>
            <div class="panel faq" v-bind:style="{maxHeight: getFaqHeight(4)}">
                <p>openpilot Automated Lane Centering (ALC) system&nbsp;does not automatically drive the vehicle or reduce the amount of attention that must be paid to the area in front of the vehicle. The driver must always keep control of the steering wheel and be ready to correct the ALC system action at all times.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot ALC, causing it to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:</span></p>
                <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor visibility (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions are interfering with sensor operation.</span></li>
                <li>The road facing camera is obstructed, covered or damaged by<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;mud, ice, snow, etc.</span>
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obstruction caused by applying excessive paint or adhesive products (such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.) onto the vehicle.</span></li>
                <li>The device is mounted incorrectly.</li>
                <li>When in sharp curves, like on-off ramps, intersections etc...; openpilot is designed to be limited in the amount of steering torque it can produce.</li>
                <li>In the presence of restricted lanes or construction zones.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>When driving on highly banked roads or in presence of strong cross-wind.</li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extremely hot or cold temperatures.</span></li>

            <div class="panel faq" v-bind:style="{maxHeight: getFaqHeight(8)}">
            <p>If your car is on the list of <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/docs/CARS.md#supported-cars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported cars</a>, openpilot will automatically recognize the model of your car by performing a scan of relevant ECU firmware versions present in your car. The presence of certain ECU firmware versions is an indication of the model year, car brand, car model, and trim.</p>
            <p>If your car isnâ€™t recognized as supported, your device will fall back to a dashcam only mode, preserving the stock functionalities and the user will receive a notification on the screen.</p>

            <div class="panel faq" v-bind:style="{maxHeight: getFaqHeight(9)}">
            <p>All software updates are received over-the-air (OTA). openpilot will automatically check for updates when connected to the internet. Your device will notify you on the screen when an update is available and prompt you to reboot the device to complete the update.</p>
            <p>You may also manually check for update in the settings, under the "software" tab.</p>

Please reference the <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/docs/CARS.md#supported-cars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported car list</a> for vehicle specific speed limitations. Maximum speed is the same as the maximum speed that stock ACC can be set to (car dependent) with a hard limit at ~84mph.</p>

            <p>A fingerprint is the method openpilot uses to determine which vehicle it is connected to.</p>
            <p>Current methods use vehicle ECU firmware logging. openpilot will fingerprint the vehicle on each start up.</p>
            <p>If openpilot detects a firmware version not previously logged, it will need to be added to the codebase. Guides on adding new firmware can be found <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki/Fingerprinting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
