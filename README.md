## stiction_whip (aka deadband)

 ## At least one major bug. DO NOT USE !!
 ## No PEDAL !!

Prius has a problem with static friction somewhere in steering.

Try to overcome small movement limitation with quick, jerky moverments.

  -'Stuck' detection

  -Move to desired whip angle over multiple MPC update cycles

  -Return to originally desired angle, quickly

  -Return control back to OP
