# Example User Scripts

This folder contains examples of interfacing data with foxglove native schemas
using the user scripts feature of foxglove. You can create a new user script in
foxglove and copy the example into that user script to begin using it. Each of
these examples is already handled during the log conversion process, however
they could be useful starting points for handling other data.
