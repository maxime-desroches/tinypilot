## stiction_whip (aka deadband)

 ## No PEDAL !!

Prius has a problem with static friction somewhere in steering.

Try to overcome small movement limitation with exaggerated desired angle, until something close to the desired angle is reached.

  -'Stuck' detection

  -Move to desired whip angle over multiple MPC update cycles
  
  -Return control back to OP
